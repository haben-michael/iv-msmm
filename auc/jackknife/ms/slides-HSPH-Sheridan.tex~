  \begin{columns}
    \begin{column}{.7\textwidth}
      \textbf{Sports argument:} Bill Belichick is a great coach: When average players come
      to play for him, their performance jumps up; when they leave, they
      become average again.

    \end{column}
  \end{columns}
  \textbf{Causal framework:} Players have a potential outcome, their performance
  under Belichick and not under Belichick. This pre/post comparison
  approximates the difference between the potential outcomes.

  \textbf{Sports counter-argument:} It's not Belichick. He's just been
  fortunate . . .

  \textbf{Causal framework:} The association between Belichick (treatment) and
  player performance (outcome) is spurious; it exists due to a
  confounder. Is there some variable associated with treatment and outcome?

  \speak{  The potential outcome allows us to formulate causal
    questions. Sometimes these questions can be answered using
    associational measures like regression (e.g., randomization) but
    other times there is a difference between the association and the
    causal relationship. The reason is that something might }

      \textbf{Sports counter-counter-argument:} But there was one year when the
      quarterback was injured, and new players that year also performed better than usual.

  \textbf{Causal framework:} There are no unmeasured confounders; we can obtain
  the causal effect by controlling for the known confounder.
