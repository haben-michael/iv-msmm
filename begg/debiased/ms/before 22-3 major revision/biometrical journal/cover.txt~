We present a correction to Begg's test for publication bias, first
published in this journal in 1994 and currently one of the two most
popular formal tests of publication bias. The correction boosts the
power of the by about 17% in our simulations. While the gain is
arguably modest, there is little downside to using the corrected test,
and we present examples drawn from the literature where the boost in
power does in fact make a difference. (We would have happily submitted
this as a Reader's Response, but the instructions page suggest that
submission should be made within 3 years of the original article.)
