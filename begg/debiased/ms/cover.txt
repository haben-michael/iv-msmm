We present a correction to Begg's test for publication bias, currently
one of the two most popular formal tests of publication bias. The
correction boosts the power of the by about 17% in our
simulations. While the gain is arguably modest, there is little
downside to using the corrected test, and we present examples drawn
from the literature where the boost in power does in fact make a
difference.
